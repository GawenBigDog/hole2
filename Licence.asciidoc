BUSTER Academic Licence Agreement:
(Please read carefully. You may want to print a copy for reference)

FOREWORD
Global Phasing Limited is pleased to make the production version of its software available free of charge to academic users (as defined below). There is no time limit on this availability: our practice of issuing licence keys for 1 year periods is only a means of encouraging users to update their software regularly. The extension of academic licences is a straightforward operation carried out by the users themselves, which is in no way dependent on any form of payment whatsoever.

BUSTER END USER LICENCE AGREEMENT
ACADEMIC VERSION
GRANT.
Global Phasing Limited ("GPhL") hereby grants you a non-exclusive licence to use its accompanying software product BUSTER (the "Software") free of charge if and only if

     	you are a student, faculty member or staff member of an educational institution, or an employee of a charitable non-profit organisation, engaged in non-proprietary scientific projects, i.e. projects all results of which will be made public without preferential prior disclosure to a for-profit organisation.

Government agencies are not necessarily considered charitable non-profit organisations for the purposes of this licence agreement.

If you do not fit within the description above, you are not eligible for an academic licence and you should instead apply for a commercial licence. If you are using the Software free of charge, you will not be entitled to support or telephone assistance.

You may not:

    permit other individuals to use the Software except under the terms listed above;
    modify, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble (except to the extent applicable laws specifically prohibit such restriction), or create derivative works based on the Software;
    copy the Software (except for back-up purposes);
    rent, lease, transfer, or otherwise transfer rights to, the Software;
    remove any proprietary notices or labels on the Software. 

In addition, the Software may not be utilized by an end-user engaged in activities related to weapons of mass destruction, including but not necessarily limited to, activities related to the design, development, production or use of nuclear materials, nuclear facilities, or nuclear weapons, missiles or support of missile projects, or chemical or biological weapons.

SOFTWARE.
This licence does not grant you any right to any enhancement or update.

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
Since the Software is provided free of charge, the Software is provided on an "AS IS" basis, without warranty of any kind, including without limitation the warranties of merchant-ability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.

IN NO EVENT WILL GPhL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THIS LICENCE TO THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF GPhL SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY OTHER PARTY. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. FURTHERMORE, SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION AND EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
